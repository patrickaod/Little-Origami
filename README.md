## Overview

![Little Origami on different screen sizes](documentation/responsive-img.png)

Little Orgiami is designed to be a seemless flow of information for the reader to enjoy, understand, and use. 

This is accomplished through three responsive HTML/CSS pages: 

### The First Page

The index page contains demonstation videos, brief informative articles, and interactive elements that aim to inspire confidence in the user.

![Little Origami Index Page](documentation/overview/index-pg.jpeg)

### The Second Page

The history page utilises scroll animations to tell the story of Jui-Jitsu as it travelled from Japan through brazil to the rest of the world. 

![Little Origami History Page](documentation/overview/history-pg.jpeg)

### The Final Page

The contact page allows users to send a message through a bootstrap form in order to foster a community around Little Origami.

![Little Origami Contact Page](documentation/overview/contact-pg.jpeg)

### Additional Pages 

Two additional pages were added to increse the depth and flexability of the site. 

#### 404 Page

The 404 page enabled the early deployment and review of the site. As content was updated so to were unfinished link that lead to the 404 page. 

![Little Origmai 404 Page](documentation/overview/404-pg.jpeg)

#### Confirmation Page

The confimation page adds depth to the form submission experience. Thanking the user for their input before returning them to Home Page completing their journey around the website.

## UX

The goal of the design for Little Origami was to be a balance between striking and elegent. Reflective of the current trends within the martial arts space. 

Libral use of contrasting colours, with bold images caputes the striking element. While, the fonts and the flow and the flow of information showcase an elegent or refined aesthetic.

### Colour Scheme 

A trend among martial arts websites is to use red, black, and yellow on a white background. This is a nod to the white gui adorned by the different coloured belts within the sport. Grey and darker shades are generally thrown in to contast these colours. The effect is an overall refined but striking website; perfect for martial arts. 

For this project, I chose to mostly follow this trend. As the colour palette for this website looks as follows: 

![Little Origami Colour Palette](documentation/colours/colour-scheme.png)

#### Color Application 

I opted to use #212529 - Eerie Black for the background colour as it tied the website's logo, content, and design better than a lighter alternative. 

The #FFFF00 - Yellow, FF0000 - Red, & #870000 - Dark red were all chosen to make the website as stiking as possible, which all were used in the creation of the logo and branding.

 The colours were then used as follows:

- #FFFF00 - Yellow was use for the all the links and primary headings. 

- #FF0000 - Red was used for all subheadings. 

- #870000 - Dark Red was used in combination with black as a gradient background colour, and hovered links. 

- #FFFFFF was used for the primary text to keep good contrast. 

- #000000 was used in certain instances when the background was a lighter colour. 

#### Additional Colours 

For the two additional pages, I chose an alternative background to add some personallity into my project. As way of leaving my mark (a trademark) on the project. 

The colours I used were applied as a 45&deg; gradient and are as follows:

- #833AB4 - Grape 
- #FD1D1D - Red 
- #FCB045 - Orange (web)

![Alternative Background Colours](documentation/colours/alt-colours-chm.png)

### Typography

The aim of the font and icons are to create a fluid reading experience. Roboto was great choice as for readability, as evidenced by being a consistent top trending font on google fonts store.  

However, I've opt to make the headings in a more eastern style of type. The eastern style gives an impression of elegance, but also legitimacy. Legitimacy that can be traced back through tested history from today to in this case fudal Japan. Therefore, this is a very important consideration for the website. 

All font and icons used are as follows:
 
- [Protest Revolution](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Revolution?query=protest+revolution) was used for the logo brand and primary headings.

- [Protest Strike](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Strike?query=protest+strike) was used for the subheadings. 

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all the non-heading text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the navigation icons in the header.

- [Bootstrap Native Font Stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/) was used as a back-up collection of font families.

- Sans-Sarif was used as a final redundant font. 

The Font Awesome icons were a great addition to the website adding an extra layer of refinement, especially using the east-asia-world icon for the history navigaiton link.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Bootstrap 5 - Navigation bar**

    - An easy to use navigation menu, that gives user-friendly access to all the available content on the site. This benefits the user by respecting their time, and has an overall positive effect on their user experience.

![Little Origami Navigation Menu](documentation/features/nav-menu.png)

- **Bootstrap 5 Carosuel - Hero Banner**

    - An introductory slideshow aimed at showcasing interesting aspects of Jui-Jitsu in picture form. The focal point can then be used to draw users attention to something more specific in the future. This benefits the user by giving them a sense of what to expect. 

![A introductory slideshow](documentation/features/hero-banner.png)

- **Introduction-Text**

    - The introductory text aims to give guidence to new users, by inform them the intent of the website and where to go next. Therefore, this paragraph was designed as a sign post. It had to be short, to the point, with as much information as possible for the user to navigate more quickly. 

![Home page introduction](documentation/features/intro-p.png)

- **Introductory-Video**

    - Joe Rogan is one of the most well recognised people in the world, and is very knowledgable about Jiu-Jitsu. As he himself has a black belt and is a commentator for the UFC. Adding this content here breaks up the text for the users.Giving them something else entertaining to enjoy. The value this delivers to the website is legitimacy, as Joe Rogan is reputable source on the sport that many people like. 

![Home page introduction](documentation/features/intro-vd.png)

- **The Technique Cards**

    - The technique cards are animated HTML/CSS cards that reveal hidden content. The goal was to present the information in a more interest way. The design idea was to simulate the flipping off an opponent in Jiu-Jitsu, making a fun and interactive experience for the user. 
    
    - The effect doesn't require any JS. Making run times faster and a better overall user experience. 

![Home page introduction](documentation/features/flip-cards.png)

- **Beginner's Guide**

    - The beginner's guide is short list of helplful tips that a user can easily and understand, in order to feel more confident to make a decision. 
    
    - Instead of writing a list and staking the infomaiton, I opted to display the infomration in a Bootstrap carousel. It made the presentation more compact and ultimately more fun for the end user. Improving the overall experience. 

![Home page introduction](documentation/features/b-guide.png)

- **Demonstation Videos**

    - The demonstation videos were extra content added to make the section more interesting to the user, and take away from the emptiness retaining that intrest. 

![Home page introduction](documentation/features/demo-vd.png)

- **Footer**

    - The footer at the end of the page isn't the end. The user can follow us on social media or contact us directly. It was important to keep the user engaged in the site to see all the content, instead of clicking off when they reach the bottom. This is why there are a collection of links and a call to action in the footer to help prompt the user.
    
![Home page introduction](documentation/features/footer.png)

- **History Page - Scroll Animations**

    - The scroll animaitons add an entertainment value to the text. Making the content more engaging and valuable to the user. 

![screenshot](documentation/features/hist-scoll.png)

- **Contact Form**

    - The contact form allows the users to feel more connected to the website. To form a community around Little Orgiami. Legitimising the site and potentially creating repeat visiting users.

    - The page was design to incentavise free bug reporting and was seen as a great opportunity for user relations. 

![screenshot](documentation/features/404-cats.png)

- **Confirmation Message**

    - The confimration message provides assurance to the user their request was sent. It's an additional layer of design quality.

![screenshot](documentation/features/loading-message.png)

### Local VS Deployement 

 The local deployment of a website exists on a developer's computer during the development phase, where changes and testing occur. The live deployment of a website refers to the process of making the finalized and tested website live on a web server for public access. The local environment is a controlled and private space for development, while the deployment is the public-facing version of the website.
