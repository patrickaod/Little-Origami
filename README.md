## Overview

![Little Origami on different screen sizes](documentation/responsive-img.png)

Little Orgiami is designed to be a seemless flow of information for the reader to enjoy, understand, and use. 

This is accomplished through three static HTML/CSS pages: 

### The First Page

The index page contains demonstation videos, brief informative articles, and interactive elements that aim to inspire confidence in the user.

![Little Origami Index Page](documentation/overview/index-pg.jpeg)


### The Second Page

The history page utilises scroll animations to tell the story of Jui-Jitsu as it travelled from Japan through brazil to the rest of the world. 

![Little Origami History Page](documentation/overview/history-pg.jpeg)

### The Final Page

The contact page allows users to send a message through a bootstrap form, in order to foster a community around Little Origami.

![Little Origami Contact Page](documentation/overview/contact-pg.jpeg)


### Additional Pages 

Two additional pages were added to increse the depth and flexability. 

#### 404 Page

The 404 page enabled the early deployment and review of the site. As content was updated so to were unfinished link that lead to the 404 page. 

![Little Origmai 404 Page](documentation/overview/404-pg.jpeg)


#### Confirmation Page

The confimation page adds depth to form submission experience. Thanking the user for their input before returning them to Home Page completing their journey.

## UX

The overall design of Little Origami was to be a balance between striking and elegent. Reflective of the current trends within the martial arts space. 

Libral use of contrasting colours, with bold images caputes the striking element. While, the fonts and the flow of the overall information seek to provide an aesthetic of elegence or refinement.

### Colour Scheme 

A trend among martial arts website is to use red, black, and yellow on a white background. This is a nod to the white gui adorned by the different coloured belts. Grey and darker shades are generally thrown in to contast these colours. The effect is an overall refined but striking website; perfect for martial arts. 

For this project, I chose to mostly follow this trend. As the most commonly used colours were black, yellow, and red. The colour palette looks as follows: 

![Little Origami Colour Palette](documentation/colours/colour-scheme.png)

#### Color Application 

I opted to use #212529 - Eerie Black as the background. It tied the website's logo, content, and design better than a lighter alternative. The logo and branding are the focal point for this decision as it is better highlighted by the darkness. 

The #FFFF00 - Yellow, FF0000 - Red, & #870000 - Dark red were all chosen to make the website as stiking as possible, and were used as follows:

- #FFFF00 - Yellow was use for the all the primary links and headings. 

- #FF0000 - Red was used for all subheadings. 

- #870000 - Dark Red was used in combination with black as a gradient background colour. 

- #FFFFFF was used for the primary text as to keep good contrast. 

- #000000 was used in certain instances when the background was of a lighter colour. 

#### Additional Colours 

For the two additional pages, I chose an alternative background to add some personallity into the project. As way of leaving my mark (a trademark) on the project. 

The colours I used in a 45&deg; gradient are as follows:

- #833AB4 - Grape 
- #FD1D1D - Red 
- #FCB045 - Orange (web)

![Alternative Background Colours](documentation/colours/alt-colours-chm.png)

### Typography

The aim of the type and icons is to create a fluid reading experience, but displayed in an eastern style. 

The eastern style gives an impression of elegency and refinement, but also adds legitimacy. Legitimacy that can be traced back through history. Therefore, this is a very important consideration for the website, and is achieved through the following fonts & icons:
 
- [Protest Revolution](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Revolution?query=protest+revolution) was used for the logo brand and primary headings.

- [Protest Strike](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Strike?query=protest+strike) was used for the subheadings. 

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all the non-heading text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the navigation icons in the header.

- [Bootstrap Native Font Stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/) was used as a back-up collection of font families.

- Sans-Sarif was used as a final redundant font. 

Protest Revolution & Strike were a great choice to represent more tranditonal eastern styles, while Roboto creates a nice reading expience for the bulk of the content. 

The Font Awesome icons were a great addition to the website adding an extra layer of refinement, especially using the east-asia-world icon for the history navigaiton link.

### Local VS Deployement 

 The local deployment of a website exists on a developer's computer during the development phase, where changes and testing occur. The live deployment of a website refers to the process of making the finalized and tested website live on a web server for public access. The local environment is a controlled and private space for development, while the deployment is the public-facing version of the website.

#### Missing Links

Some of media links direct to the main site of where the website were found. This is due to not having all of them being saved for whatever reason, and all attempts to find them again failed. Moving forward, I'll make it a priority to save all media whether it is used or not.
